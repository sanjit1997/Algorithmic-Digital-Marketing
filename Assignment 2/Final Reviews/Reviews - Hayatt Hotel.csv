Hyatt vacation club avoid buying into scheme if none US national.,We have been Hyatt vacation club owners for nearly 20 years. With the pandemic and lockdowns we’ve not used them for the last 2 years( very understandable). Unlike U.K. companies that have tried look after people after holidays have been cancelled by ensuring refund rebook or credit eg Airbnb. Hyatt offer nothing to international owners.They argue they are open but as US government have closed borders to Europe holiday makers then this is irrelevant (I wouldn’t be so aggravated by this if us citizens weren’t on holiday in Europe).My advise if you live outside the US do not buy into this scheme. You have no protection.
Jordan…,We stayed at the Grand Hyatt - Amman hotel in Jordan and it was a highlight of the holiday. Nice to relax after a hot dusty day at the spa and two pools. Everything was empty due to covid 19  which added to the luxury and feeling of space.  Staff were excellent.
Morocco,Hotel in morocco was amazing. Present in the heart of city
Amazing buffet,he Buffet at this palace was amazing. One of the best location and buffet
Best Parking lot,The Parking lot of the hotel was very nice. It infact made the hotel standout
Stay here for consistent quality,Stay here for consistent quality - and for slightly less than the rest usually. Never encountered any big issues.
Hyatt House Charlotte Center City,We were transiting through Charlotte NC and stayed at Hyatt House Center City.  We were very impressed with the hotel as it was a very nice property.  The front desk staff were very friendly and the room was excellent.  We did experience one disappointing thing.....on Monday night we went down to the bar about 8:45pm to get a drink and some food.  The bartender said she was closing at 9 so hurry up....I asked if there was enough time and she said yes as long as we order now.  We ordered drinks and I ordered a turkey bacon sandwich.  I was given the bill immediately and told credit cards haven't been working so I had to pay cash or charge to the room.  I asked her to try it and she said no it's not working.  So reluctantly I paid cash for both the bill and a tip.  The drinks were served in plastic cups and when I got the food it was not served on a plate it was in a Styrofoam container.   I had to ask for a napkin and all I got were drink napkins no utensils and delivered with a plastic bag to go......so we got the hint that she wanted us out of there even though she already said there would be enough time.   At this point I was already regretting the 25% tip I gave her.  Then I got back to the room and went to eat and realized the bread was stale and the bacon was cold.  It was overall the worst turkey bacon sandwich I ever had.This was a very disappointing experience of a generally great overall stay at a great hotel.
Great experience in Venice,We stayed at the Hyatt Centric on Murano recently and felt thoroughly pampered from beginning to end. Wonderful location beautiful hotel and very attentive service. The best breakfasts we have ever had in a hotel (including the gluten free versions).
Just a terrible customer service expierence,Two days of trying to adjust a work trip reservation. multiple phone calls with over then 40 min waits and nothing resolved. I will never use Hyatt for any personal trips in the future. Just insane that you cant change a reservation with online chat. Best advise is to stay somewhere else then have to deal with Hyatts lack luster of customer service
Pool color,No hotel room is big and the Buffay but I do not like the color of the pool and the smell of it
The Queen Room,The Queen Room is very beatiful and has an amazing view
It’s my partners birthday and I phoned…,It’s my partners birthday and I phoned the Hyatt regency Birmingham to ask if the pool is available . But I’m very disappointed to hear that each family or person is only allowed 45 minutes in the day to swim . This very small amount of time and with the increase of room prices makes Hyatt even less appealing . We have been staying at this hotel for years now with my family and sometimes booking 3 days in a row . Please I request the manager to change the rules for swimming like an hour per turn and then there’s a swap but you can have another turn later if there is space in the pool . As the pool is the main reason we use to book the hotel especially in the summer months .
Rude and bad service at  Hyatt in orange county on…,I stay in the Hyatt in orange county on Harbor Street service was very bad it was dirty  and the manager was very rude I asked for my room to be clean was never clean they never gave me an explanation why they didn’t clean it  customer service was really bad and rude I don’t know how they get away with it but they charge top dollar
very niceeeee,very niceeeee
Not allowed to return to fully paid room,I went on a business trip to Boulder. My company paid for my stay in Hyatt Place Boulder / Pearl Street. I decided to return one day earlier and notified the concierge. My flight was delayed. When I tried to return to my paid room they say I can’t and they need a manager to allow me to return to my fully paid room. The manager obviously was not there because it was night. Hyatt dead for me now.
Always stay here for oustanding quality…,Always stay here for oustanding quality and hospitality.
Receptionist,They were very friedly at hayatt palace and helping hand for all travellers
RUDE!! Please don't waste time\\money with this hotel,Hyatt Place Downtown\\loop located at 28 N Franklin Chicago IL. 60606 312-955-0950. The staff at this location was EXTREMELY rude & UNHELPFUL. This is a SELF-service hotel. First they will only clean your room every 4 days (I see Covid is NOT a factor). Second if you need additional towels the staff ask you to come to front desk (COVID NO social distancing) but of course GREED rules the world. Please do NOT waste your time nor money at this location. Still waiting on return calls from the GM & Hyatt corporate office (4 days AFTER my stay).
Park Hyatt Dubai is stunning and highly…,Park Hyatt Dubai is stunning and highly recommended. The gardens and pool area plus the villas are one of the best 5 star experiences you’ll ever have.  Superb.
I stayed for three nights at the Hyatt London Heathrow…superb experience.,I stayed for three nights at the Hyatt Hotel at Heathrow Airport in early October 2020.  Was allowed to check in at 7.30am.  (Hyatt Hotel at Hayes wanted to charge me an extra night for this privilege so there is some inconsistency in practice.)After having spent three years in northern Iraq ('Kurdistan') the comfort of the bed was delightful.  Overall a very smooth and efficient operation.  Room superb (standard room) food very good and convenient short free bus service to Heathrow Airport to do shopping.  (This service is not provided by Hyatt but by London Transport but the bus stop is just outside the hotel.)
I have been staying at the Hyatt… and I wanted to tell everyone about Danyelle,polite and knowledgeable. She is a problem solver.  When she talks to me she treats me with respect and makes our encounter's positive.  I am thankful that she works at the Hyatt. She has impacted my stay in a very positive way.  Thank you Danyelle
