The fact that you could take classic records back to your room and play them on your own record player located in the room was so fun!! The pool was insanely cool and the on-site restaurant one of the best meals I had on my vacation. Complimentary breakfast was generous. Location was decent -- the only way to get any closer to Fenway Park would be inside the stadium itself. Use the app Parking Whiz to access cheaper parking. We found safe 24 hour parking within a 5 minute walk from the hotel for $25.'],\n",

I love the overall design scheme of ‘70’s punk/rock & roll subculture. The record players in every room with the library of records in the lobby to choose from was a genius touch. The pool area was great, my meal at Hojoko was excellent and the complimentary breakfast was the best setup I’ve seen since covid- very smart setup. At the front desk, Olivia was wonderful- she recognized on the phone that I was a local on a staycation and went way out of her way to make sure I had a good time during my stay, from an early check-in to ensure I had some extra pool time, to a complimentary room upgrade, she really went the extra mile, while offering good advice'],\n",

This hotel is like walking through a Rock and Roll museum! The breakfast was FABULOUS also. Staff were all so friendly. Safe and walkable area. The beds were super comfortable and the hotel was surprisingly quiet at night (and we are super picky about that). Loved playing some vinyl LPs in the room too. Also fun having my picture taken right underneath Mick on that yellow couch in the lobby! Highly recommend this hotel. The only surpise was the $25 fee per night, but that's because I didn't read the fine print when booking online. Rock and Roll, Hoochie Coo, right on!\"],\n",

The location was great if you are going to a Sox game! We had a room that had a view of Fenway, and actually opened our window one night and listened to part of the game while we watched in on our in room flat screen TV with the sound muted. The rooms were very clean, so a shout out to Karen who took care of ours! The game we did'],\n",

Breakfast was amazing and Amalia prepped waffles, bagels, and smoothies with a smile! Employees all seemed happy. Thomas at checkin also was positive and always helpful.

Hojoko, the next door Japanese restaurants, is excellent for its food and jelly sake. There are also lots of restaurants around within walking distance. The parking is a bit steep at $65/day, but it beats running to meters all day or trying to find a parking spot without being stressed out. Also, it is right next to Fenway Stadium.

Joey, who checked us in was super friendly and welcoming, and Cisco, the valet, was really cool. We drove up into the wrong driveway, but he took care of us anyway.

After we checked in, we were shown the amp that was a refrigerator holding bottles of water for the guests and the vinyl record collection you could borrow from to use in your room which was equipped with a record player. The rooms were nice but I could have used a newer mattress. The hotel located right beside Fenway. We could literally see one of Fenways walls from the small hotel pool. The pool was amazing!

Understandably, parking is a luxury in Boston, but it would have been nice to have a slightly better rate, considering the price of the room was almost $250/night. Complimentary breakfast was surprisingly good - they had a nice spread of fruit, waffles, oatmeal, cereal, bagels, toast, smoothies, coffee/juice/tea, etc. Room was very clean, check in and check out were quick and easy. We would stay at this hotel again, but would recommend not bringing a car if you can avoid it. Ubers around the city are cheap, and many things are within walking distance.',\n",

What’s not A deal is the cost— over $600/night + taxes + parking fee, but it was a busy Sox/Yankees weekend and I was in a bind. Too much $$ BUT the friendly staff and great room made up for it, and they very generously gave me a small discount and a late checkout 🙌 Really comfy king bed, huge TV w/lots of channels, huge bathroom and the cool rock ‘n roll paraphernalia give the rooms and the whole hotel a great vibe.

The one thing I didn\\\\t like is the amenities fee, which covers access to the heated saltwater pool, the LPs and unlimited free water in the lobby mini fridge (which looks like a speaker). This wasn\\\\t divulged ahead of time. I didn\\\\t see it on their website. So what are you going to do at check in? Say no... and go look for another hotel?

Hotel is cool and on trend, lots of fun rock memorabilia everywhere. LOVED having a record player in our room and made use of it (and the free bottled water and free Nitro-Brew in the lobby) daily. Very good sushi restaurant on site with live music. Walking distance form the Berklee/Boston Conservatory Campus (and I think Boston University.)

It\\\\s got a cool and funky vibe that isn\\\\t TOO cool and funky; my 18 year old liked it, and so did I. The rooms are clean, the mattresses are comfortable, and the bathrooms very nice.

We stayed during “hurricane” Henri so we weren’t able to utilize the pool but we had a balcony room overlooking the pool so good enough.

They welcomed us when we came in at 1AM with clapping and great big smiles . We felt very welcome and it kicked off a great two night stay.',\n",
       " 'We loved staying here for 4 nights while visiting our son who lives in the area. It was our first hotel stay since COVID started. This hotel is like walking through a Rock and Roll museum! The breakfast was FABULOUS also. Staff were all so friendly. Safe and walkable area. The beds were super comfortable and the hotel was surprisingly quiet at night (and we are super picky about that). Loved playing some vinyl LPs in the room too. Also fun having my picture taken right underneath Mick on that yellow couch in the lobby! Highly recommend this hotel. The only surpise was the $25 fee per night, but thats because I didnt read the fine print when booking online. Rock and Roll, Hoochie Coo, right on!',\n",
       " 'Loved our stay! Awesome place and attention to detail! The breakfast was awesome, the rooms fabulous and all the amenities. The staff was so lovely and helpful- we ate at the restaurant on property and it was delish. We can not wait to come back!',\n",
       " 'We stayed 6/29-7/1 and had a great experience. You will not find a better staff. Everyone was so welcoming and fun to be around. It’s right next to Fenway park. Aracely cleaned our room and did a phenomenal job! We will stay again.',\n",
       " 'We just returned from a four night stay and cannot recommend the place enough! From check in (and out) with Jordan, the stay started out excellent and stayed that way the entire visit. From the amazing music vibe and memorabilia, the the very retro and fun rooms (including your own record player, with access to a huge library of loaner records, a vintage typewriter and a clutch fan for those of you that are used to blasting your ceiling fan at night! The location was great if you are going to a Sox game! We had a room that had a view of Fenway, and actually opened our window one night and listened to part of the game while we watched in on our in room flat screen TV with the sound muted. The rooms were very clean, so a shout out to Karen who took care of ours! The game we did',\n",
       " 'We had a amazing time staying here for a Red Sox game. The musical theme was on point. The record players and LPs in the room were such an awesome touch and the free nitro coffee in the lobby was also a big hit!! We will be staying here whenever we’re in Boston. Super fun and super friendly!',\n",
       " 'Visiting Boston with our teenage son. We all loved this place. Music/rock vibe is fun, pool lovely on a sunny day, great location next to Fenway, not far from the Charles, and 3 blocks to Fen park with paths, a track, b-ball hoops, and a beautiful rose garden. Breakfast was amazing and Amalia prepped waffles, bagels, and smoothies with a smile! Employees all seemed happy. Thomas at checkin also was positive and always helpful. Really enjoyed dinner at Hojoko too- great cocktails and interesting food. Was worried slightly about party atmosphere at pool but it was always shut down right at 10 to ensure all guests can have a good sleep.',\n",

      "Visiting Boston with our teenage son. We all loved this place. Music/rock vibe is fun, pool lovely on a sunny day, great location next to Fenway, not far from the Charles, and 3 blocks to Fen park with paths, a track, b-ball hoops, and a beautiful rose garden. Breakfast was amazing and Amalia prepped waffles, bagels, and smoothies with a smile! Employees all seemed happy. Thomas at checkin also was positive and always helpful. Really enjoyed dinner at Hojoko too- great cocktails and interesting food. Was worried slightly about party atmosphere at pool but it was always shut down right at 10 to ensure all guests can have a good sleep.\n",
